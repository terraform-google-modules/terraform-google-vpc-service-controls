# Access Perimeter Submodule

This module handles opiniated configuration and deployment of a [access_context_manager_service_perimeter](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/access_context_manager_service_perimeter.html) resource for regular service perimeter types.

## Usage
```hcl
provider "google" {
  version     = "~> 2.5.0"
}

module "org_policy" {
  source      = "terraform-google-modules/vpc-service-controls/google"
  parent_id   = var.parent_id
  policy_name = var.policy_name
}

module "regular_service_perimeter_1" {

  policy         = module.org_policy.policy_id

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| access\_levels | A list of AccessLevel resource names that allow resources within the ServicePerimeter to be accessed from the internet. AccessLevels listed must be in the same policy as this ServicePerimeter. Referencing a nonexistent AccessLevel is a syntax error. If no AccessLevel names are listed, resources within the perimeter can only be accessed via GCP calls with request origins within the perimeter. Example: 'accessPolicies/MY\_POLICY/accessLevels/MY\_LEVEL'. For Service Perimeter Bridge, must be empty. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| access\_levels\_dry\_run | (Dry-run) A list of AccessLevel resource names that allow resources within the ServicePerimeter to be accessed from the internet. AccessLevels listed must be in the same policy as this ServicePerimeter. Referencing a nonexistent AccessLevel is a syntax error. If no AccessLevel names are listed, resources within the perimeter can only be accessed via GCP calls with request origins within the perimeter. Example: 'accessPolicies/MY\_POLICY/accessLevels/MY\_LEVEL'. For Service Perimeter Bridge, must be empty. If set, a dry-run policy will be set. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| description | Description of the regular perimeter | `string` | n/a | yes |
| egress\_policies | A list of all [egress policies](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules#egress-rules-reference), each list object has a `from` and `to` value that describes egress\_from and egress\_to. | <pre>list(object({<br>    from = any<br>    to   = any<br>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| egress\_policies\_dry\_run | A list of all [egress policies](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules#egress-rules-reference), each list object has a `from` and `to` value that describes egress\_from and egress\_to. | <pre>list(object({<br>    from = any<br>    to   = any<br>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| ingress\_policies | A list of all [ingress policies](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules#ingress-rules-reference), each list object has a `from` and `to` value that describes ingress\_from and ingress\_to. | <pre>list(object({<br>    from = any<br>    to   = any<br>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| ingress\_policies\_dry\_run | A list of all [ingress policies](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules#ingress-rules-reference), each list object has a `from` and `to` value that describes ingress\_from and ingress\_to. | <pre>list(object({<br>    from = any<br>    to   = any<br>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| perimeter\_name | Name of the perimeter. Should be one unified string. Must only be letters, numbers and underscores | `any` | n/a | yes |
| policy | Name of the parent policy | `string` | n/a | yes |
| resources | A list of GCP resources that are inside of the service perimeter. Currently only projects are allowed. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| resources\_dry\_run | (Dry-run) A list of GCP resources that are inside of the service perimeter. Currently only projects are allowed. If set, a dry-run policy will be set. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| restricted\_services | GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if storage.googleapis.com is specified, access to the storage buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access restrictions. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| restricted\_services\_dry\_run | (Dry-run) GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if storage.googleapis.com is specified, access to the storage buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access restrictions.  If set, a dry-run policy will be set. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| shared\_resources | A map of lists of resources to share in a Bridge perimeter module. Each list should contain all or a subset of the perimeters resources | `object({ all = list(string) })` | <pre>{<br>  "all": []<br>}</pre> | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| perimeter\_name | The perimeter's name. |
| resources | A list of GCP resources that are inside of the service perimeter. Currently only projects are allowed. |
| shared\_resources | A map of lists of resources to share in a Bridge perimeter module. Each list should contain all or a subset of the perimeters resources |
